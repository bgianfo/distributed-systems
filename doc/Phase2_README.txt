Installation
	1. Servers
		The servers are up and running along with the load sharers.
	Everything concerning the server is ready to go and requires no
	installation.
	
	2. Web Client
		No installation necessary. Simply open your preferred web browser
	and navigate to distrivia.lame.ws. The web client will display the
	login/register screen. Instructions on how to use the web client are
	below.
	
	3. Android Client
	
Usage
		The web client and android client share the same format to make it
	easy to navigate and understand both clients without learning a new
	interface. The gameplay for our application is broken up into 4
	distinct activities or screens: login/register, join public/private, 
	compete, and view leaderboard. The activities work in this order and
	descriptions of the activities and how to use them is explained below.
	
	1. Login/Register
		This is the first screen you will see when loading both the web
	client and the android client. If you have not previously registered
	a username and password, you will want to type a username and password
	and select the "Register" button. Otherwise, if you have a username
	completed, you may type your username and password in and select the
	"login" button. If login/registration is successful, you will be taken
	to the join screen. Otherwise, make sure you are using the correct
	username and password and try again.
	
	2. Join (Public/Private)
		The join screen gives you the option to join a public round,
	compete in a private round, or view the current global leaderboard.
	Currently, private round competition is	not available. 
		If you would like to view the current global leaderboard, you 
	may select the "View Leaderboard" button. The global leaderboard 
	shows the standing of the players based on all their rounds 
	they've played. 
		If you're ready to compete in a public game, select the 
	"Join Public" button. You will be shown a waiting screen until
	enough players have joined public games to compete with. Currently,
	the number of players in a public game to start a round is 2. Once
	enough players have joined, the round will begin and you will be 
	taken to the compete screen.
	
	3. Compete
		The competition screen will display a series of questions and
	and answers. Currently, this screen is only fully implemented on
	the web client. Read the question, select an answer and then select the
	"Ok" button. This will submit your answer and you will be given more
	questions and answers until the round is over. Depending on the client,
	you will see different reactions for whether you have answer the
	question correctly. Once the round is completed, you will be taken back
	to the join screen to join another round. If you are competing on the
	android client, you will be taken to the round leaderboard to see the
	scores of the other players in the round. For the web client this is
	shown while in the round.
	
	4. View Leaderboard
		The leaderboard screen shows the standings of players of Distrivia.
	There are two forms of the leaderboard. One leaderboard shows the players
	with the global rankings. This global leaderboard can be accessed from the
	join screen using the "View Leaderboard" button. The other leaderboard
	shows the rankings of the players in a round. For the web client, this is
	shown while competing in the round. For the android client, this is shown
	upon completion of the round.
