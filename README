Installation:

  1. Servers
  ----------
  The servers are up and running along with the load sharers.
  Everything concerning the server is ready to go and requires no
  installation.

  2. Web Client
  -------------
  No installation necessary. Simply open your preferred web browser
  and navigate to distrivia.lame.ws. The web client will display the
  login/register screen. Instructions on how to use the web client are
  below.

  3. Android Client
  -----------------
      a) Simulator - Open Eclipse (must be setup with Android SDK). 
          From the menu, select File->Import... When the window pops up,
          select "Exisiting Project" from the "General" folder. Navigate
          the import window to:
              /src/clients/android
          Select the project and click through to complete import. When
          the project is loaded, you may Run as Android Application. This
          will launch the Android Simulator and load the application.
      b) Device - follow the steps followed at the following link:
          http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html

  4. iPhone Client
  ----------------
  Currently, the iPhone client does no talking to the server. 
  But if you would like to install and look at the UIs and progress,
  follow these instructions.

    a) Simulator - Open the XCode project file using a Mac:
       /src/clients/iphone/distrivia/distrivia.xcodproj
       Select to use the simulator and make sure you have
       iPhone selected from the dropdown box in the upper-left.
                   The simulator should pop open and load the app.

    b) Device - For this to work, the device must be registered
       with the "CS Development" Provisioning Profile. If this
       is the case, follow the same steps for running the app
       using the simulator (above) but choose device from the
       dropdown box instead of simulator.
       The app will install on the device and run
       automatically.

 Usage:
 ------

  The web, android, and iPhone clients share the same format to make it
  easy to navigate and understand each client without learning a new
  interface. The gameplay for our application is broken up into 4
  distinct activities or screens: login/register, join public/private,
  compete, and view leaderboard. The activities work in this order and
  descriptions of the activities and how to use them is explained below. The
  iPhone client currently only shows the views and does not support any of
  the functionality of the application.

  1. Login/Register
  -----------------
  This is the first screen you will see when loading from any client.
  If you have not previously registered a username and password, you will
  want to type a username and password and select the "Register" button.
  Otherwise, if you have a username completed, you may type your username
  and password in and select the "login" button. If login/registration is
  successful, you will be taken to the join screen. Otherwise, make sure
  you are using the correct username and password and try again.

  2. Join (Public/Private)
  ------------------------
  The join screen gives you the option to join a public round,
  compete in a private round, or view the current global leaderboard.
  Currently, private round competition is not available.
    If you would like to view the current global leaderboard, you
  may select the "View Leaderboard" button. The global leaderboard
  shows the standing of the players based on all their rounds
  they've played.
    If you're ready to compete in a public game, select the
  "Join Public" button. You will be shown a waiting screen until
  enough players have joined public games to compete with. Currently,
  the number of players in a public game to start a round is 2. Once
  enough players have joined, the round will begin and you will be
  taken to the compete screen.

  3. Compete
  ----------
  The competition screen will display a series of questions and
  and answers. Currently, this screen is only fully implemented on
  the web client. Read the question, select an answer and then select the
  "Ok" button. This will submit your answer and you will be given more
  questions and answers until the round is over. Depending on the client,
  you will see different reactions for whether you have answer the
  question correctly. Once the round is completed, you will be taken back
  to the join screen to join another round. If you are competing on the
  android or iphone client, you will be taken to the round leaderboard to
  see the scores of the other players in the round. For the web client
  this is shown while in the round.

  4. View Leaderboard
  -------------------
  The leaderboard screen shows the standings of players of Distrivia.
  There are two forms of the leaderboard. One leaderboard shows the players
  with the global rankings. This global leaderboard can be accessed from the
  join screen using the "View Global Leaderboard" button. The other leaderboard
  shows the rankings of the players in a round. For the web client, this is
  shown while competing in the round. For the android and iphone clients,
  this is shown upon completion of the round.
